# MTConnectSharp4Unity3D
A Simple MTConnect C# Client Library port from [MTConnectSharp](https://github.com/mtconnect/MTConnectSharp) to Unity3D

From the original...

This library was originally written to monitor individual data items as they changed to better facilitate rule development in the early days of MTconnect. As such it was written to be as simple as possible, so it does not support much beyond simple probe parsing and quasi-streaming the CDATA of dataitem tags as they change.
